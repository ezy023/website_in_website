# Website-in-a-Website

At the end of Phase 2 at Dev Bootcamp we were given a challenge to build anything type of web app we wanted using what we had learned up to that point. 

I thought it would be cool to create a site where you could enter html on the page, hit a button, and the typed html would render as a webpage 'automagically'. So that idea spawned this small app.

At the time I was very much a beginner with front-end tech and this was a awesome because it gave me the opportunity to work a lot with Javascript and jQuery. Some key takeaways from this project were capturing keypresses, binding events to various keys, and capturing the page content and then rendering the text as actual html.

#####Setup:

If you want to play with this app first run:

`git clone https://github.com/ezy023/website_in_website`

then: 

`bundle`

start the server:

`shotgun`

and play!
